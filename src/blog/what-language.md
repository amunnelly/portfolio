title: What Programming Language Should Someone Learn?

Learn [Python](https://www.python.org/).

What's the most important thing in learning a programming language for the first time? It's getting used to the whole notion of programming, so that a firm base exists from which the learner can go on to learn other languages, compare each language's strengths and weaknesses, and be able to make value judgements on the best technology to solve a particular task.

What are the alternatives to `Python`? You can learn [C](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_intro.php), because all modern computing languages come from `C`, in the same way all Romance languages - French, Spanish, Italian - derive from Latin. But `C` is a bit heavy when you've never programmed before, and `Python` provides a gentler slope.

You can learn [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), because `JavaScript` can't be escaped. You'll eventually have to learn some `JavaScript`, because it's very hard avoid `JavaScript` even if you want to, but while `JavaScript` itself is comparatively simple, its environment is like something from the planet in Avatar - just when you think you've something figured out, there's always something else just around the corner. It's a challenge to keep up with it all.

There's a case for [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), but `Java` is a little verbose for those just starting out. There is no case to be made for [C++](https://cplusplus.com/), which even developers of long standing are just that little bit afraid of.

[SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) aren't quite coding languages. `SQL` exists to talk to databases, and `HTML` and `CSS` exist to lay out websites. Anything outside of those functions is beyond them. You will learn them as you need them, but you can't learn `HTML`, say, and then turn around and say you can code, because this is not the case.

Rubyists will always insist that the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) syntax is the most human-understandable of syntaxes. Well, maybe it is and maybe it's not. There's a case that [COBOL](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=languages-cobol) is the easiest language to read, as it was created to be easy to read. `COBOL` is old technology now. `Ruby` is as user-friendly as `Python` - the two are very similar, really - but `Ruby` is popular really because of the incredible popularity of the web framework that was created for `Ruby`, [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). No `Rails`, no `Ruby`. That's not to knock `Ruby`, of course, but it does mean that if you want to do something else in `Ruby`, like data analysis, say, the packages aren't really there.

There is a language called [R](https://www.r-project.org/) that was created for data analysis alone, and its advocates will accept no substitute. But while `Python` may not be as fast at data analysis as `R`, or have as good a web framework as `Ruby`, or provide the sheer computing horsepower of `C++`, or the ubiquity of `JavaScript`, there is no language that provides all of those at once as well or as comprehensively as `Python`.

Learn `Python` first. That's the answer.
