_Who_ and _whom_ are both pronouns. The difference between them is that _who_ is a subject pronoun and _whom_ is an object pronoun.

English sentences, in general, are made up of a subject, a verb and an object. The subject does the action, the object has the action done unto it, and the verb is the action. 

Pat punched Mike - _Pat_ is the subject, _Mike_ the object, to punch is the verb.

He punched Mike - _he_ is the subject, _Mike_ is still the object, to punch is still the verb.

Pat punched him - _Pat_ is the subject, _him_ is the object, and to punch is still the verb.

Now. You'll notice that a different pronoun is used when the noun the pronoun replaces is the subject or object of a sentence. If the noun is the <span class='subject'>subject</span> we say <span class="subject">he</span> or <span class="subject">she</span>. If the noun is the <span class="object">object</span> of the sentence we say <span class="object">him</span> or <span class="object">her</span>.

And this is where who and whom come in. We use <span class="subject">who</span> when the answer is the <span class="subject">subject</span> of the sentence (<span class="subject">he/she</span>), and <span class="object">whom</span> when the answer is the <span class="object">object</span> of the sentence (<span class="object">him/her</span>.)

<span class="subject">Pat</span> punched <span class="object">Mike</span>.

<span class="subject">Who</span> punched Mike? <span class="subject">He</span> punched Mike.

<span class="object">Whom</span> did Pat punch? Pat punched <span class="object">him</span>.

<span class="subject">Mary</span> kicked <span class="object">Kate</span>.

<span class="subject">Who</span> kicked Kate? <span class="subject">She</span> kicked Kate.

<span class="object">Whom</span> did Mary kick? Mary kicked <span class="object">her</span>.

<span class="subject">Frank</span> gave a ring to <span class="object">Mary</span>.

<span class="subject">Who</span> gave Mary a ring? <span class="subject">He</span> gave Mary a ring.

To <span class="object">whom</span> did Frank give a ring? <span class="subject">He</span> gave a ring to <span class="object">her</span>.

Easy, really.

| Subject | Object  |
| ------- | ------- |
| He/She  | Him/Her |
| Who     | Whom    |
