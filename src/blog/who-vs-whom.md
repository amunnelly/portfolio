_Who_ and _whom_ are both pronouns. The difference between them is that _who_ is a subject pronoun and _whom_ is an object pronoun.

English sentences, in general, are made up of a subject, a verb and an object. The subject does the action, the object has the action done unto it, and the verb is the action. 

Pat punched Mike - _Pat_ is the subject, _Mike_ the object, to punch is the verb.

He punched Mike - _he_ is the subject, _Mike_ is still the object, to punch is still the verb.

Pat punched him - _Pat_ is the subject, _him_ is the object, and to punch is still the verb.

Now. You'll notice that a different pronoun is used when the noun the pronoun replaces is the subject or object of a sentence. If the noun is the subject we say he or she. If the noun is the object of the sentence we say him or her.

And this is where who and whom come in. We use who when the answer is the subject of the sentence (he/she), and whom when the answer is the object of the sentence (him/her.)

Who punched Mike? He punched Mike.

Whom did Pat punch? Pat punched him.

Mary kicked Kate.

Who kicked Kate? She kicked Kate.

Whom did Kate kick? Kate kicked her.

Frank gave a ring to Mary.

Who gave Mary a ring? He gave Mary a ring.

To whom did Frank give a ring? He gave a ring to her.

Easy, really.

| Subject | Object  |
| ------- | ------- |
| He/She  | Him/Her |
| Who     | Whom    |
