I'm Anthony Munnelly, a data analyst of seven years standing. Before that, I worked in content writing and did some freelance journalism. You can see the full gory details on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonymunnelly/).

I've been able to cross over from a profession that's dying to a profession that's thriving because we now live in an age where knowledge has never been more accessible to so many people for so little cost. 97%[^*] of the knowledge base of the world is available online. That's never happened before. No library in history was ever that big - not in the [Vatican](https://www.vaticanlibrary.va/en/home.php), not in the [British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/), not in [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria). It's astonishing.

Not only is the knowledge out there but a peculiarly altruistic movement seems to have developed whereby people are willing to share that knowledge for free, for the benefit of others. I would not have been able to learn what I have learned myself without them, and I mention the ones who have had the most influence on me in the [Roll of Honour]({{ "../roll" | url }}) page. Everyone there does a better job of what I'm trying to do here, and I'm only kidding myself to think otherwise.

However. Even back at school I realised that there is more than one way to teach something. There was a big crossover between Maths and Physics back in the day, and each teacher had a different way of explaining the common ground - trigonometry, say. From that I realised that the more explanations a student has before her, the better the chance of one resonating with her and helping her make progress. And I feel like I owe it to those who went before me to try to pay it back a little and, as such, here I am. I hope this is some use to somebody, somewhere.
